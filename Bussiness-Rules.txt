Project: Kilometers per truck

The company needs to measure how many kilometers do each of its trucks register for every service they do to a given city and for every extra kilometers not destined to work (go to lunch - fuel load - truck service - others)

Bussiness rules:

- A truck (driver) will have multiple services to different cities (must specify the package to deliver)
- One service may be delivered by more than one truck (driver) with transship
- A city will be visited by multiple drivers (through each service)
- The driver for this release (beta) will be in charge if required to register a new city

DB model:

User (Driver)
Fields:

- user_id							-> int 			not null
- name								-> string 	not null
- timestamps					-> datetime not null

Travel (Kilometers per service)
Fields:

- travel_id						-> int 			not null
- author_id (user FK)	-> int 			not null
- name					      -> string 	not null
- kilometers		      -> int		not null
- timestamps					-> datetime not null

Group (City)
Field:

- group_id						-> int 			not null
- author_id (user FK)	-> int 			not null
- name                -> string   not null
- icon      					-> string		not null
- timestamps					-> datetime not null


Relationships:

- One User has_many Travel's (1,*)
- One User has_many Group's (cities) registered (1,*)

- One Travel belongs_to one Author (User) (1,1)
- One Travel belongs_to One Group (city, destiny) (1,1)

- One Group (city) belongs_to one Author (User) (1,1)
- One Group (city) has_many Travel's made by many User's (1,*)

* Constraints:

- One Group (City) CAN NOT BELONGS to more than one Author (User)
	* Although, one Group will be visited by many Users through Travels
- One Travel CAN NOT BELONGS to more than one Group (City)

* Permissive
