## About The Project

Small app with a thematic of delivering enterprise services to keep the record on their vehicle kilometer travels.

It is designed to cover the need to measure how many kilometers do each of the registered trucks on every service they do, to a given city and for every extra kilometers unworked (lunch - fuel load - mechanic service - others)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Clone or fork the <a href="https://github.com/ricardovaltierra/kilometers-per-truck">repo</a> [git@github.com:ricardovaltierra/kilometers-per-truck.git]

As a user once you registered are able to do the following:

- Register multiple travels you've made (Per service)
  * Specify the package to deliver
  * The kilometers traveled
  * The destiny (City) if it's an offical travel
- See all the travels you've made in your profile
  * View the official & unofficial travels separately (Unofficial does not have a destiny)
- View available citys for destiny and register a new one if required

## How it Works

### Step 1: Clone and install dependencies

Clone the repo and run `bundle install` to get all the gems on your terminal.

### Step 2: Run database migration

From terminal type `rails db:migrate` to get your schema updated

### Step 3: Work on IRB

That's it on configuration. Now you can just open your terminal to start on `rails server` and open your browser

### Step 4: View your app

Now you can navigate to `localhost:3000` on your browser to see your app working.
Feel free to create as many travels as required. If you want to record an official travel you will have to go first to register a city if there is no one.
